Task3. Randomly place queens on the chessboard so that they do not hit each other.

I have created two algorithms in this project. Firstly the algorithm do 30 attempts to place queens randomly so that they can't hit each other. 
Secondly, in some cases where there are some possible places left to place queens, the algorithm fill them with queens.
